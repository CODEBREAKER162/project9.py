iter --> this is used to run in the form of a loop 
iterator : --> this stores ther data and gives the next data we need

lambda function --> it is used only as a single line code 
syntax :
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5))  # Output: 25


programing paradigms are divided into two types they are
imperative and declerative
imperative is like step by step process that we should do Print all even numbers from 1 to 10
# for i in range(1, 11):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i)

# declerative : this is the think which we order food like what do we need 
# SELECT number FROM numbers_table WHERE number % 2 = 0;



# again imperative is divided into structural and oops
# 
#  
# structural--> is breaks program into functions and procedures
# -->data and function are seperated 
# int add(int a, int b) {
#     return a + b;
# }

# int main() {
#     int result = add(5, 3);
#     printf("%d", result);
#     return 0;
#}
# oop-->break ststment into class and objects
# data and finction are cobined
# class Calculator {
#   public:
#     int add(int a, int b) {
#         return a + b;
#     }
# };

# int main() {
#     Calculator c;
#     cout << c.add(5, 3);
#     return 0;
# }

functiona dn logical

structure and union 
structure have diffrennt memory and union have all one emory , equal to the maximum size

, 

ADT : Abrstract data type this is done but we dont know interior working details 
focous on what is done but not focoused on whag it is done 

linklist:it stores data in the form of nodes example:
[10|1200]-->[20|2330]--->[30|23455]
